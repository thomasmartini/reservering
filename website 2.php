    1. I have the rights to decline your commission request.<br>

    <br>
    3. No haggling in prices. Prices are in EURO!<br>
    <br>
    4. Please make sure you get the information right. I'm not going to make a million edits on the artwork.<br>
    So make SURE you give me the right information to draw your art piece.<br>
    <br>
    5. No returns after I've started on the piece! If I am not able to finish the artwork because of MY circumstances I will 100% refund the money!<br>
    <br>
    6. The artpiece will be done within 2-3 weeks MAX depending on the size of your request.<br>
    If you are interested in the progress please contact me through Discord (Surfer#9112) or DA notes.<br>

    <br>
    7. I can do every artstyle that I've in my gallery. It's up to you which one you pick.<br>
